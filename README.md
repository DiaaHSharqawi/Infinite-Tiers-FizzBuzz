# Infinite-Tiers-FizzBuzz

A simple JavaScript implementation of the classic FizzBuzz problem, themed as "Infinite-Tiers-FizzBuzz".

## Description

This project prints numbers from 1 to 100 to the console, but with a twist:
- For multiples of 3, it prints `Infinite`.
- For multiples of 5, it prints `Tiers`.
- For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints `InfiniteTiers`.
- For all other numbers, it prints the number itself.

## Files

- `index.html`: Basic HTML file to include the JavaScript logic.
- `index.js`: Contains the core logic for the Infinite-Tiers-FizzBuzz.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to run the script (output will be in the browser console).

Or, run the JavaScript directly in Node.js:

```bash
node index.js
```
